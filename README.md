## Problem Statement
X Education faces a significant challenge with its lead conversion rate, currently standing at 30%. To address this, the company seeks to implement a predictive lead-scoring model, aiming for an ambitious 80% conversion rate. The primary objective is to identify 'Hot Leads' efficiently â€“ those with a higher probability of conversion. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project aims to optimize the sales process and enhance the overall efficiency of lead conversion.

The expected outcomes of the project include the development of a robust lead-scoring model that can accurately prioritize leads based on their conversion potential. This prioritization will enable the sales team to focus efforts on leads with a higher likelihood of conversion, ultimately increasing the overall conversion rate. Users can engage with the project by exploring Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model building, running the provided code to implement the lead-scoring model, and contributing to the project's development through pull requests. The project is maintained and contributed to by the X Education team, with a commitment to improving lead conversion processes and welcoming community contributions.

## Expected Outcomes
- Develop a predictive lead-scoring model.
- Prioritize leads for higher conversion rates.
- Optimize the sales funnel for increased efficiency.
